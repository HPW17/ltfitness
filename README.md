## **Introduction**
We developed and optimized a fully functional wellness website for the capstone project, with a mission to promote a healthy lifestyle. This project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply full-stack web development skills, from front-end prototyping in Figma to writing clean, optimized code. The primary goal was to create a high-performance, user-friendly platform that would serve as a professional public-facing resource.
